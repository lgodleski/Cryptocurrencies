##Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze cryptocurrency data using unsupervised machine learning. We processed the data, clustered it, reduced the dimensions, and reduced the principal components using PCA. This extensive report shows what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped together to create a classification system for a new investment.
